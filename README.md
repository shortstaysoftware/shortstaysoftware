### Hello Encode AI Bootcamp! 👋

Not impressed with my Github activity? Sorry, it's all in private repo's - rest assured, I code every day!

Here's some reasons I should join your next batch:

-  😍 I'm obsessed with AI.  I spent my life savings in November spending 5 weeks in San Francisco to get the lowdown on the current state of AI development.
-  🛠️ I love building.  My whole life, I've been building tech solutions to real world problems.
-  💖 I love helping others.  I ran an incubator programme within my vertical (airbnb property management) that helped launched several hundred businesses, hand-holding them through launch to scaling.  I've helped a handful of the most successful ones grow to over £1m ARR.
-  📚 I love learning and sharing knowledge.  My previous niche podcast had nearly 100 episodes, and I'm launching a new podcast "AI Augmented".
-  🚀 I'm an entrepeneur through and through.  I've never had a real job, I've spent 20 years relying on solving real problems for real people in order to put food on the table.
-  🌀 I have ADHD. It stopped me learning coding until relatively recently (lo-code ftw) but I now realise I need to surround myself with other passionate people to stay motivated and enthusiastic.

Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispoulterai/), I would love to be a part of the next batch of the Encode AI Bootcamp!
